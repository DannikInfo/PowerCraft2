# PowerCraft 2
Power Craft is the mod about energy and mechanisms such as teleporter, conveyor, logic... and you yourself probably remember what is this mod about. After all this is the old good PowerCraft by MightyPork, XOR and Rapus.

Once I saw that it hasn't been updated very long time.
And I decided that I needed to correct this injustice and started writing code a few years ago. Over time and tediously through the hardships of learning Java and blacksmithing, I achieved a result that can be shown to people.

I solved some bugs, optimized code and added some new features(in future).
Now it ported for 1.7.10 and will be released for newer versions soon.

### What modules are missing:
- Weasel
- Hologram (not all, he has big mistakes when rendering)
- Mobile
- Core(small fixes craftingtool now it's portable workbench)
- Checkpoints (I want to know if they really needed)
All modules will be in the future added and fixes. 
You already can enjoy old powercraft on new version of Minecraft
